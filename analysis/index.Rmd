## Overview

This website contains the code and results implementing my exploratory
analyses of the "mixture distribution" optimization problem. See
[here](normmix.html) for a brief description of the problem.

All the webpages were generated by rendering the
[R Markdown documents](https://github.com/pcarbo/mixopt/tree/master/analysis)
into webpages, and they should be reproducible on your computer. See
the [README](https://github.com/pcarbo/mixopt) for details.

These are the results of my analyses.

2. [QP demo with equality constraints.](qpdemo2.html)

3. [Illustration of EM and IP solutions to mixture optimization 
problem.](normmix.html)
